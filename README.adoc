:author: Pedro Lamar√£o <pedro.lamarao@gmail.com>

Gradle Metal is a suite of Gradle plugins for bare metal development,
primarily design to support project link:https://github.com/pedrolamarao/metal[Metal].

Features:

* compile assembler, c and c++ sources (with support for c++ modules)
* assemble applications and (static) libraries
* cross-compilation support
* compilation commands database support
* source dependency on included project or build
* binary dependency on prebuilt external project
* LLVM tools

[WARNING]
This project is under early development.
Compatibility *will be broken* without prior notice.
In particular, we will *not* stabilize our Gradle dependency before Gradle 9.

A C++ library project with modules support is defined as simply as:

[source,kotlin]
----
plugins {
    id("br.dev.pedrolamarao.metal.library")
    id("br.dev.pedrolamarao.metal.cxx")
}

library {
    compileOptions = listOf("-std=c++20")
}
----

Check the link:samples[] for a variety of use-cases.

Current requirements:

* Gradle 8.6 or newer
* JDK 17 or newer
* LLVM 16 or newer (with `clang`, `clang-scan-deps`, `lld`, `llvm-ar` etc.)

To use the development version, you may install from source with `./gradlew publishToMavenLocal` and configure your project's settings like this:

[source,kotlin]
----
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        mavenLocal()
    }
    resolutionStrategy {
        eachPlugin {
            if (requested.id.id.startsWith("br.dev.pedrolamarao.metal.")) {
                useModule("br.dev.pedrolamarao.gradle.metal:plugins:0.5")
            }
        }
    }
}
----

Under construction:

* build flavour (e.g. `debug`, `release`)
* shared library
* source dependencies on cmake project
* binary dependencies from maven repository
* GCC tools
* MSVC tools
