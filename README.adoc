Current capabilities are:

* compiling multiple languages (assembler, c and c++)
* assembling multiple components (static archives, shared libraries and executables)
* generating compile commands database (for clang-check, CLion etc.)
* dependencies from subproject, prebuilt project
* LLVM toolset

Under construction:

* dependencies from cmake project, included build, maven repository
* GCC and MSVC toolsets
* variant flavours (release, debug)
* variant target machines (any "triple")
