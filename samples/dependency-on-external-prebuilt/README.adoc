= dependency on external archive

This sample demonstrates an application with dependency on an external prebuilt archive.

The prebuilt archive is link:https://github.com/google/googletest[googletest].
It is assumed that the "release" configuration is prebuilt in `googletest/src` as if:

* `git clone https://github.com/google/googletest googletest/src`
* `cmake -S googletest/src -B googletest/src`
* `cmake --build googletest/src`

To build this sample inside a `gradle-metal` source tree, run: `../../gradlew --include-build=../.. build`

Look for the executable file in `application/build/exe`.
