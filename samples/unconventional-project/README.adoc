= unconventional project

This sample demonstrates a project with source directories in a style different from gradle-metal convention.
An archive is generated from C sources in `lib`.
An application is generated from C++ sources in `tool`, with an include dependency on CPP headers in `lib` and a link dependency on the archive.
Object files are expected in `obj`, archives and executables in `bin`.
The various tasks are registered explicitly.

To build this sample inside a `gradle-metal` source tree, run: `../../gradlew --include-build=../.. build`

Look for the executable file in `application/build/exe`.
