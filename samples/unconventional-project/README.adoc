= unconventional project

This sample demonstrates a project with source directories in a style different from gradle-metal convention.
There is a limit to how flexible we can be: we accept the user's source layout, but partially impose our build layout.
The users configures object output to `obj` and assembled outputs to `bin`, but the inner layout is ours.

To build this sample inside a `gradle-metal` source tree, run: `../../gradlew --include-build=../.. build`

Look for the executable file in `bin`.
